# JavaScript Learning Project

This project is part of my journey to learn JavaScript and understand its core concepts. 💻✨

## 🧠 What I Learned

- ✅ The difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- 🔁 Loops (like `for`, `while`)
- 📦 Arrays and how to loop through them
- 🔑 Objects and how to access their properties
- ⚙️ Using `if` conditions to control the logic
- ⚙️ Using '`While or do-while loop` are done 

## 💳 ATM Machine Project

I built a simple **ATM Machine Simulation** as a hands-on project. Here's what it does:

- Takes an input amount from the user
- Checks the balance
- Withdraws money if the amount is valid
- Gives an error if the balance is low

It’s a basic project, but it helped me practice everything I’ve learned so far!

## 📁 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the HTML file in a browser (if UI included) or run the JS code in a console

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add a simple UI using HTML and CSS
- Improve the logic and error handling
- Add more features like deposit and mini statement

Thanks for checking out my learning project! 🚀
